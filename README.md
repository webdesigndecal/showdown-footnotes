# Showdown Footnotes â€“ 2.1.1

![CI build status](https://travis-ci.org/Kriegslustig/showdown-footnotes.svg?branch=master)

Simply footnotes for [Showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown).

## Install

I'd advise using this extension with something like [browserify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/browserify).

```bash
npm i --save showdown-footnotes
```

```js
const converter = new showdown.Converter({ extensions: [footnotes] });
```

## Usage

```md
Some word or something that needs explaining[^1].

[^1]: The explanation.
```

That would look compile to this.

```html
<p>Some word or something that needs explaining<a href="#footnote-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.</p>

<p><small class="footnote" id="footnote-1"><a href="#footnote-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>: The explanation.</small></p>
```

### Single Line Comments

Single line footnotes can be written over multiple lines like this:

```md
[^1]: A single line
footnote
```

### Multi Line Footnotes

Shownotes-footnotes also supports multiline footnotes. You'll just need to indent the lines following the superscript.

```md
[^5]:
  This is a paragraph.

  _That_ is another paragraph which is still within the same footnote.
```

Multiline footnotes are wrapped in a `<div>` instead of a `<small>`.

```html
<div class="footnote" id="footnote-5">
  <a href="#footnote-5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>:
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  <p><em>That</em> is another paragraph which is still within the same footnote.</p>
</div>
```

### Backlinking

WDD's fork supports backlinking! Clicking on a footnote annotation will take you to a footnote's text, as expected, and clicking on the footnote index next to a footnote's text will take you back to the footnote annotation.
